***Hi there ðŸ‘‹*** My name is **Mikhail Kuznetsov**. Currently I'm a software engineer student at NRNU MEPhI, Moscow, Russian Federation. I am interested in machine and deep learning research, computational mathematics and robotics :)

### :computer: List of technologies

My main programming language is Python 3, because it is very useful and comfortable for performing machine learning experiments. I am familiar both with classical methods (linear regression, gradient boosting, SVM, naive Bayesian e.g.) and deep learning models. I use Google Colab and Kaggle in order to train the models. Also you can check out my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/mmkuznecov).

You can see set of mostly used technologies and libraries below:

### :construction_worker: Job experience

I have interned at [Copter Express company](https://coex.tech), working on open-source UAV educational kit [Clever](https://github.com/CopterExpress/clover). Here you can find the article about the [face recognition system](https://clover.coex.tech/en/face_recognition.html) for it, meanwhile code for the project can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/mmkuznecov/face_recognition_from_clever). Also I have interned at [Sber company](https://github.com/Sberbank-Technology) as a junior developer, where I have worked on NLP tasks.

### :rocket: Projects

* [Face recognition from clever](https://github.com/mmkuznecov/face_recognition_from_clever) - face recognition system for [CLEVER](https://github.com/CopterExpress/clover) drone kit.
* [Parser combinators for syntax errors searching](https://github.com/mmkuznecov/Parser_combinators_for_syntax_errors_searching) - research on metaprogramming for code syntax error search.
* [AIvsBIAS](https://github.com/mmkuznecov/AIvsBIAS) - little research on removing gender bias for Word2Vec NLP models.
